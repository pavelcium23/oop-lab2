Light-emitting diode (LED). An LED display is a type of LCD that uses a set of LEDs as its light source, rather than the types of backlights (often cold cathode fluorescent lamps) used for lsd displays. LED technology is generally smaller and lighter than the original LCD. A newer type of LED is the organic LED OLED, which uses an organic polymer as the semiconductor material. And a more recent type of LED is the quantum dot LED (QLED), which incorporates a layer of nano particles to improve color and luminance.
